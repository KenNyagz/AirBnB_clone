A team project between me(KenNyagz) and maureen-chepr on Creating an Airbnb clone.
Purpose is to get exposure to some backend operations such as creation and storage of objects into files
As well as deletion and updating of the objects.
Creation of a command interpreter that automatically handles the storage of objects and other commands 
The project will be added upon as we continue with the program
